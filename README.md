### Learning Multithreading in Python

Multithreading is an advanced topic in all programming languages.
In this tutorial I'm going to implement some examples to have better understanding of multithreading programming.

#### List of patterns:
- **example-1**: running two function in concurrent manner
**description**: Suppose we have two function f and g. These functions return some integer value at the end of their
long running. What we want to do is running these two function simultaneously instead of running first f and then g. 
- **example-2**: using concurrent.futures package
