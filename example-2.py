# concurrent.futures

# Python 3.2 introduced the concurrent.futures module that provides a simpler interface
# to bring together both the threading and multiprocessing modules. It makes use of the
# ThreadPoolExecutor and ProcessPoolExecutor classes to manage thread and process pools,
# which share much of the same interface to make switching between multithreading and multiprocessing easier.
# Interface aside, the concurrent.futures module is conceptually the same as the threading and multiprocessing modules.
